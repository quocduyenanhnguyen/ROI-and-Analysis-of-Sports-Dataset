# Software I used: 
Microsoft Excel 

# First project: 
I was primarily in charge of building a model in Excel spreadsheet to determine ending fund balance and corresponding rate of return as well as generating insights from my model for retirement savings. I also formatted the PowerPoint slides and delegated tasks for our group presentation. You can preview the screenshot of a few of my PowerPoint slides here:

# Second project: 
For the second project, I was in charge of exploring and visualizing Sport Ticket Sales dataset by creating pivot tables, scatter plot, line graph, and bar chart, and then made my recommendations. I concluded my analysis with a group written report that includes my tables and visualization, I was also in charge of formatting the report and helping my teammates visualize and analyze the dataset.
